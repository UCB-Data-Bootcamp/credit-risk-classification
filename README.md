# Module 20 Report


## Prepare the Data

* Loading data

## Logistic Rergression 

*Create test and train datasets
*Create model using the train set
*Validate the model with the test set
*Evaluate accuracy of model with score, confusion matrix and classification reports

## LR with overampled data

*Create new oversampled data by fitting the original training data to the random_oversampler model
*Repeat logistic regression analysis and evaluate the performance

## Summary

*Oversampling the training data improved our logistic regression performance
